### Project Title
**Bikeshare Data Analysis**

### Description
The **Bikeshare Data Analysis** project is designed to provide insights into bikeshare usage patterns across three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This project processes and analyzes bikeshare data to reveal trends and statistics including:

- The most popular times for bike travel (by month, day of the week, and hour)
- The most frequently used start and end stations
- Statistics on trip durations
- User demographics such as user types, gender distribution, and birth year statistics

The analysis helps understand usage patterns and can be used to improve city bike-share programs and user experience.


### Files used
- `bikeshare_analysis.py`: The main Python script used for data analysis. This script handles data loading, filtering, and statistical analysis.
- `chicago.csv`: CSV file containing bikeshare data for Chicago. Includes details such as start time, end time, start station, end station, and trip duration.
- `new_york_city.csv`: CSV file containing bikeshare data for New York City, formatted similarly to `chicago.csv`.
- `washington.csv`: CSV file containing bikeshare data for Washington, formatted similarly to `chicago.csv`.
- `README.md`: This documentation file which provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage details, and other relevant information.
