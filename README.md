### Project Title
**Bikeshare Data Analysis**

### Description
The **Bikeshare Data Analysis** project is designed to provide insights into bikeshare usage patterns across three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This project processes and analyzes bikeshare data to reveal trends and statistics including:

- The most popular times for bike travel (by month, day of the week, and hour)
- The most frequently used start and end stations
- Statistics on trip durations
- User demographics such as user types, gender distribution, and birth year statistics

The analysis helps understand usage patterns and can be used to improve city bike-share programs and user experience.
